                <figcaption id="img-caption"> Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist 
                    who is widely held as one of the most influential scientists. Best known

            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Alber Einstein life:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>1879</strong> - 14 March 1879
                Ulm, Kingdom of Württemberg, German Empire</li>
              <li>
                <strong>1895</strong> - Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, 
                forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg)
                 the following year.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1900</strong> - Einstein graduated from the federal polytechnic school in 1900,
                 duly certified as competent to teach mathematics and physics.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1901</strong> - Einstein's first paper,
                 "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen" 
                 ("Conclusions drawn from the phenomena of capillarity"),
                  in which he proposed a model of intermolecular attraction 
                  that he afterwards disavowed as worthless,
                 was published in the journal Annalen der Physik in 1901
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1905</strong> - At first Einstein’s 1905 papers were ignored by the physics community.
                 This began to change after he received the attention of just one physicist, 
                perhaps the most influential physicist of his generation, Max Planck, the founder of the quantum theory.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1905</strong> -published a paper where he modeled the motion of 
                the pollen particles as being moved by individual water molecules,
                 making one of his first major scientific contributions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1912</strong> - he returned to his alma mater, the ETH Zurich,
                 to take up a chair in theoretical physics.
                  His teaching activities there centred on thermodynamics and analytical mechanics,
                   and his research interests included the molecular theory of heat,
                 continuum mechanics and the development of a relativistic theory of gravitation.
              </li>
                <strong>1915</strong> - developed his theory of general relativity,
                 having earlier shown that gravity does influence light's motion.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1916</strong> - Einstein predicted gravitational waves,
                 ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves,
                  traveling outward from the source,transporting energy as gravitational radiation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1917</strong> - en el apogeo de su trabajo sobre la relatividad,
                 Einstein publicó un artículo en Physikalische Zeitschrift que proponía la posibilidad de emisión estimulada ,
                 el proceso físico que hace posible el máser y el láser .
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1919</strong> - Einstein became one of the most famous scientific celebrities 
                after the confirmation of his general theory of relativity in 1919.
              </li>
              <li><strong>1922</strong> - the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 
                voted to award Albert Einstein the previously reserved 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1935</strong> - Einstein collaborated with Nathan Rosen to 
                produce a model of a wormhole, often called Einstein Rosen bridges.
              </li> 
              <li>
                <strong>1955</strong> - Einstein experienced internal bleeding 
                caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1955</strong> - Einsteinium, a synthetic chemical 
                element, was named in his honor in 1955, a few months after his death.
              </li>
